# Welcome to Phurl! #
Phurl is a free, clever, and easy to use PHP URL shortening system. In just 5 minutes, you can get your very own URL shortener set up and working. The script comes packed with a ton of features which you won't find in other scripts, and has a very easy installation wizard to help you get started. Since the script was started in 2006, our developers have constantly worked to improve and amend the script, fixing any bugs as soon as we can.

## Features ##
  * Simple, easy and neat interface.
  * Basic admin panel to view, search for, and delete shortened URLs.
  * Notification of new version of Phurl via admin panel.
  * Shorten URLs using an alias generated by the script, or enter a custom alias.
  * Browser Bookmarklets included for one-click shortening.
  * Installs in a few minutes with built-in installation wizard.

The current version of Phurl is version 2.4.2.

A roadmap outlining the current progress with Phurl 3, and the upcoming features, is available at http://phurl.me/pq6.
